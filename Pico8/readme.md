## NutrispaceShooter - video game

This project was driven in our very first weeks of the cursus. We were in a team of 4 people, all of them changing their career and with little or not experience in coding.

We had 2 weeks to code together from scratch a game with a stack we did not know : Lua. 

This experience taught us to have more understanding on how are built the video games: 
- the creation of scenes and their update, and gaming functions. 
- how to work as a team and progress together towards the same goal : present a minimal viable project.
